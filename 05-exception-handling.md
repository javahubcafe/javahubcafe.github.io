## Q.	What are the two types of Exceptions in Java ?	Which are the differences between them ?
Java has two types of exceptions: checked exceptions and unchecked exceptions. Unchecked exceptions do not need to be declared in a method or a constructor’s throws clause, if they can be thrown by the execution of the method or the constructor, and propagate outside the method or constructor boundary. On the other hand, checked exceptions must be declared in a method or a constructor’s throws clause. See here for tips on Java exception handling.

## Q.	What is the difference between Exception and Error in java ?

Exception and Error classes are both subclasses of the Throwable class. The Exception class is used for exceptional conditions that a user’s program should catch. The Error class defines exceptions that are not excepted to be caught by the user program.

## Q.	What is the difference between throw and throws ?

The throw keyword is used to explicitly raise a exception within the program. On the contrary, the throws clause is used to indicate those exceptions that are not handled by a method. Each method must explicitly specify which exceptions does not handle, so the callers of that method can guard against possible exceptions. Finally, multiple exceptions are separated by a comma.

## Q.	What is the importance of finally block in exception handling ?

A finally block will always be executed, whether or not an exception is actually thrown. Even in the case where the catch statement is missing and an exception is thrown, the finally block will still be executed. Last thing to mention is that the finally block is used to release resources like I/O buffers, database connections, etc.

## Q.	What will happen to the Exception object after exception handling ?

The Exception object will be garbage collected in the next garbage collection.

## Q.	How does finally block differ from finalize() method ?

A finally block will be executed whether or not an exception is thrown and is used to release those resources held by the application. Finalize is a protected method of the Object class, which is called by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) just before an object is garbage collected.
