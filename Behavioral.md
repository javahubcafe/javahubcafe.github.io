# Managerial Round

## Q. Tell me about yourself ?
I am loyal, hard-working, professional and conscientious and, having studied the job description for this role in detail, I feel the attributes I possess are a strong match. Whilst at work, I am someone who takes pride in delivering each task to a high standard and I achieve this by working closely with other people within the team. I also make sure I obtain a clear brief from my manager or supervisor as to what they want to me to achieve whilst working in the role I am employed. If successful, I am looking forward to learning the role quickly and getting to know as much about your products and services, so I can start contributing and making a positive impact within the organization.<br><br>
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to be interviewed for this position today. I have applied for the job because I believe the skills and qualities I possess are a match for the job description. I have several years experience in this industry which means I can come into your company and make a fast and immediate impact. I am a strong communicator, I work very well both on my own and as part of a team, I will always provide excellent customer service and I will always perform to a high standard whilst under pressure. I am a positive, forward-thinking person and I genuinely believe I can come into the team and help push the company forward towards achieving its goals. If you hire me, you will quickly see a positive return on your investment.<br>

## Q. Why do you want to work for us?
I want to work for you for three reasons. The first reason is based on the fact you are a forward-thinking company, and you provide excellent products and services for your customers. This means I will always be challenged in the role and I will need to work to high standards. The second reason is I feel this is a place I can learn and develop. From what I can tell, there are lots of dedicated and talented people here whom I can work alongside and learn the right way to become a highly effective employee. Finally, although I am new to work, I do want to stay with the same organization for a long period of time – based on your history and the customer satisfaction levels you constantly achieve, I think this is somewhere I will be very happy in my work.<br>

## Q. How will you contribute to our team ?
I will contribute to your team by being positive, by getting to know my co-workers, by understanding what I can do to contribute to the team objectives based on my strengths, and by analyzing what I can do to support other people in the team. I see it as my responsibility to fit into your team, be flexible and do all I can to add value to what they are already achieving.<br>

## Q. How do you prioritize tasks at work?
I prioritize tasks at work by always listening to my manager’s brief carefully, by deciding which tasks are the most important in relation to the team’s objectives, and by determining the timescale for each task to be completed. For example, in my last role, I would focus on responding to all customer queries as a priority because I knew how important it was to the success of the business. I would then concentrate on completing the project or team tasks that had a definitive timeframe for completion. Any general, non-urgent administrative tasks would be completed at the end of each week before I went home for the weekend.<br>

## Q. Tell me about a difficult work challenge you had to overcome?
I was working on a time-sensitive project at work with three other team members. We were two months into the project when our manager decided she wanted us to start the project again from scratch, whilst still sticking to the same timeframe for completion. Although it was disappointing, I put myself in her shoes and tried to understand why the project needed to change. I embraced the challenge that was presented and encouraged the other team members to do the same. We created a new plan of action, taking into consideration the restricted timescale and moved forward with a positive attitude. To ensure the project completed on time, we also recruited an additional team member. The end result was that we managed to complete the project on time, to the required standard and more importantly, to the satisfaction of my manager.<br>
